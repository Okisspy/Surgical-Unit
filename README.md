# Surgical-Unit

A hospital surgery unit was interested in predicting survival in patients undergoing a particular type of liver operation. A random selection of 108 patients was available for analysis. For each patient record, the following information was extracted from the pre-operation evaluation:

      blood:     Blood clotting score

   prog:       Prognostic index

enzyme:  Enzyme function test score

liver:        Liver function test score

age:         Age in years

gender:   I(person is female) i.e. 0 = male, 1=female

a.mod:    I(person is a moderate alcohol user) i.e. 0=none, 1 = moderate, 0 = heavy

a.heavy:  I(person is a heavy alcohol user) i.e. 0=none, 0=moderate, 1=heavy


A follow-up study ascertained the response variable, "survival time", which is the amount of time the person survived after the surgery.

The dataset available for this analysis is for the first 54 patients.
